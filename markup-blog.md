#Very Cursory Exploration
##This is a practice file
I'm now going to make a simple unordered list of random objects via Markdown language:
* Bicycle
* Oatmeal
* Kitten
* Shoe
* Chair
Now for an ordered list of the first 4 things that I do in the morning:
1. Wake up around 7am
2. Brush and floss my teeth
3. Wash down vitamins with lemon water
4. Check Instagram [here](www.Instagram.com)
5. Go for a run
